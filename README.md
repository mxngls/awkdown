# Awkdown

The following is an incomplete and somewhat naive attempt at using the
AWK programming language to create a Markdown to HTML transpiler that
conforms to the
[CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#emphasis-and-strong-emphasis)
specification version 0.31.2 (2024-01-28). While I believe this task can
be accomplished solely with AWK, my limited knowledge of compilers makes
the process more cumbersome and challenging than necessary. I plan to
revisit this project later and give it another try.
